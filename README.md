## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed this challenge. The design was relatively easy, but where I learnt the most was with the JavaScript part.

I enjoyed playing around and adding a little extra to the challenge. I tried to make the form validation happen "live".

### Continued development

I'll continue doing more challenges similar to this and keep practicing and experimenting on the JavaScript side of things.
